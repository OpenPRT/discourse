# Proprietary vs Public

Where does the public open source design and source code stop and the opportunity for privatization and profit take place?

A key idea of Open PRT is, of course, its openness. The general designs of the system must be made available for free to as many producers as possible to adequately make the system ubiquitous. The internet has prospered from the availability of intellectual property. However, it's important to note that the binary system is not patented nor is the HTTP protocol. Standardization and the implementations of those standards are separate.

## Public

The final results of the foundational components of the Open PRT system are released under the MIT license along with the many possible ways to undergo making the results.

## Proprietary

Innovating the processes from which to make the final resulting components can be innovated and patented. Also any developed systems on top of the foundation will fall under traditional patent ideology.

## Profitability

There is poorly constructed correlation between profitability and proprietary knowledge. A company can make lots of money making something that another company can duplicate simply by doing it first and doing it best. It is important to always keep in mind that private companies will be necessary to manufacture all of the infrastructure.
